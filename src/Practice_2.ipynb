        "Over a 3 month period, given a Stock price that is currently 20 ($S_0$) dollars, it is known that at the end of T= $\\frac{1}{4}$ years that this stock will be either 22 ($uS_0$) or 18 ($dS_0$) dollars. We're trying to value a call option to buy the stock for 21 dollars in 3 months (k=21 dollars).  If the stock price turns out to be 22 dollars, the value of the option will be 22-21=1 dollar; if the stock price turns out to be 18 dollars, the value of the option will be zero. There is a risk-free rate of 4% per annum compounded continuously.\n",

Using the formula $\\Delta$=$\\frac{uS_0-k}{uS_0-dS_0}$, $\\Delta$=$\\frac{22-21}{22-18}$=$\\frac{1}{4}$ shares. This means that regardless of how our stock moves, the portfolio value is $18*\\Delta=4.5$ dollars or $22*\\Delta-1=4.5$ dollars. This portfolio will also earn interest through zero bond, which means that the value of the portfolio today is $4.5*e^{-0.04*\\frac{1}{4}}$$\\approx 4.445$ dollars. To calculate the no arbitrage option price ($f$), we set 4.445=$20*\\Delta-f$, which is also the current portfolio price.

This means our portfolio has a total value of $1*1-\\frac{1}{4} *22=-4.5$, which after adding our money earned from zero bond, is positive. ($\\frac{4.5}{e^{-0.01}}>4.5$).

        "## Risk-Neutral Valuation\n",
        "An important principle in evaluating derivaties is risk neutral valuation, which states that all investors are **risk-neutral**. In this world, investors do not care about the riskiness of an asset; they only care about the expected return. This obviously contrasts with the real world, where investors typically require a higher return to compensate for taking on more risk (risk premium), but this assumption allows us for simplified and consistent pricing of derivatives by focusing on expected returns discounted at the risk-free rate, using risk-neutral probabilities.\n",

        "With $p$ being the p risk-neutral probability of the stock price going up, this would mean that $uS_0*p+dS_0*(1-p)=e^{rT}*S_0$. Solving for $p$ gives us $p=\\frac{e^{rT}-d}{u-d}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inside this risk-neutral world, the original call price ($C_0$) is equivalent to the expected value of the value of the call options after $T$ years. In the case our stock rises, the call option value will be $uS_0-k$, and if it decreases, the value is simply 0. Thus, $C_0 = (p*(uS_0-k) + (1-p)*0)*e^{-rT} = (p*(uS_0-k))*e^{-rT}$. We can now substitute $p$ from above, giving $C_0 = (\\frac{e^{rT}-d}{u-d}*(uS_0-k))*e^{-rT}$. Notice that $p$ is not in this equation, meaning that we get the same no-arbitrage price no matter if the probability is as small as 0.01 or as large as 0.99.\n"
