# Enviornment-Setup

## Abstract

Our course will be developed throughout the theory of computational finance with relevant coding experiments. The classical setup for this computing is to install anaconda with python 3.X and GitHub desktop on your computer. To ease of our installation, we will use cloud computing platform with GitHub. In this part, we will learn the followings:

- Setup GitHub account and a class repo.
- Create a Jupyter notebook with Colab and update GitHub
